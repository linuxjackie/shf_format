# Contributing to SHF Format

We love your input! We want to make contributing to SHF format as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug in the specification
- Discussing the current state of the format
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use Github to host the specification, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the specification. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added content that should be tested, add examples.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issue tracker](https://github.com/linuxjackie/shf_format/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/linuxjackie/shf_format/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## License
By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its MIT License.
